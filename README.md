# RPClogo DVD by RPCgroup

## üåê Project Overview

This project perfectly recreates the classic DVD logo screensaver with enhanced capabilities. Originally developed as a nostalgia piece, it has evolved into a full-featured animation system with:

- Pixel-perfect physics simulation
- Multi-image cycling capabilities
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Extensive customization options

The animation runs at a smooth 60 FPS and maintains perfect synchronization between logo changes and wall bounces indefinitely.
